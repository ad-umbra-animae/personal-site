      <p>The inspiration for this piece came from this track by a Ukrainian producer <b>Sky Effect - Skyport</b>.</p>

It is almost the end of my ascension to the central southern navigation tower. I have gone through three hundred 
and sixty-four steps on the marble spiral stairs, and there are thirty-six more steps to go.

<figure class="not-prose float-right w-1/2 ml-6 mb-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/skyport-ascension.jpg" alt="Crimson light" class="rounded-lg shadow">
  <figcaption class="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2">I can see the crimson light coming from above</figcaption>
</figure>

 I can already see the crimson light coming from the entrance above. It overcomes the artificial white light of the tunnel 
 lamps. It was always the sign that I was near the top of the tower during the months of my training. Today marks the first day 
 I ascend the staircase in a new capacity.   
</p>
<p>
The top of the tower has nothing but a small observation deck. The floor here is covered with smooth and warm gray material, 
which reminds me of a dolphin’s skin.
I sit down in front of the wall of glass so pure that one can hardly see it. Beyond it, there is an ocean of swirling clouds 
penetrated by the rays of a red star so big that it consumes a quarter of the visible sky.
The clouds are constantly shifting and flowing leisurely with aristocratic grace. 
Above their pale, rose-fluffy heads, I see the glass of other navigation towers reflecting coral rays of the setting sun 
through the ever-moving cloud shroud. 
</p>
<p>
I close my eyes and breathe in slowly. It is all black for a whole second and for another. 
My palms get a little sweaty, and I get ready to open my eyes, stand up, and leave. This did not happen to me during the 
training. 
Nevertheless, I give it another second, patiently. And through the void, a beam of orange light comes and touches my head 
somewhere just above my eyebrows.
It comes from one of the navigation towers that glows in the distance. 
Then other beams follow, and I am finally linked up. I see the world with my eyes closed. 
It’s not seeing in a regular meaning, as I become inseparable from the world and fathom its subtlety in its entirety. 
I become the tower, every cloud, every water droplet in it, every molecule in the drop.
</p>
<p>
A shimmering golden lattice permeates everything.</p>

<figure class="not-prose float-left mr-6 w-1/2 ml-6 mb-4">
  <img src="/assets/images/skyport-ship.jpg" alt="Dragonfly ship" class="rounded-lg shadow">
  <figcaption class="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2">A shimmering golden lattice permeates everything</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I have connected with everybody that I knew all along; they were always a part of me.
I was them and they were me. We are now inseparable.</p>
<p>
Suddenly, we all hear a faint call from a distant star. 
A feeble apparition of spheres and a long, curved, snake-like hull appears in the sky.
It’s a beautiful and exotic spaceship that reminds me of a dragonfly. 
Inside the dragonfly, there is an entity who is in need. It's a pilot asking for a passage. 
</p>
<p>
I, all of us, start doing what we do best: we wish for this ship to come to us. 
And the strangest thing happens: the shimmering golden lattice that permeates the world starts to bend and twist,
 creating a gaping hole around a ghostly shadow of the ship. 
</p>
<p>
The spheres and body gain color, weight, and… presence? 
The golden strings are taut; it’s hard to hold them apart for long. We let it go. 
</p>
<p>
The wormhole collapses, the golden grid reverberates with wild undulations. 
Waves propagate like circles on the water after you throw a stone into a lake. They sparkle bright yellow as the 
lattice bends and twists. 
</p>
<p>
Now that the ship is closer, I sense the presence of more sentient beings aboard. 
Some are radiating curiosity, while others are showing impatience or even anxiety. 
The pilot dispenses gratitude that washes over like a warm breeze. It’s nourishing and energizing. 
The ship takes off into the distance.
</p>
<p>
The solemn solitude is back. I focus on the flickers of the golden lattice and patiently await the next request 
from stars afar. 
</p>
