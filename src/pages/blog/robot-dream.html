<b>Dream sequence.</b><br> I’m sitting in a room, minding my own business. Next to me, a couple of guys are watching an exciting stream on the TV. I pay little attention, but I slowly grow curious about what they are so excited about. I ask, they explain. It’s a stream transmitted to the whole world by an intelligent robotic system that now holds its creators hostage by deploying anti-cognitive fields, which stop any cognitive process within a volume of space. With no cognition or information processing inside that bubble, time stops, and any living being becomes frozen, much like in a sci-fi stasis field.

<p>
The robotic entities read the stream chat and periodically decant their hostages from the anti-cognitive field to question them. Sometimes, they update their intelligence models and deploy humans to assess their new capabilities, using humans as guinea pigs in a sandbox environment.

I found it amusing that robots use humans much like we use AI models right now. And that other humans found great enjoyment in this stream because it was so edgy.
