Searching is an innate quality of the human mind, which is what led homo sapiens to conquer the animal kingdom and 
emerge on top. We were searching for food, shelter, sources of fire, and water before we had names to give and ideologies 
to claw at each other’s throats over bitterly. The process is facilitated by a developed prefrontal cortex, which is 
primarily responsible for executive decision-making and planning, as well as inhibition and disinhibition. 
It guides the spotlight of our mind in the brooding darkness of the chaotic, intimidating world we can barely fathom 
and rarely control.

One of the most significant benefits of having this searchlight is the ability to turn it inward and illuminate what lies hidden beneath the dark waters of our subconscious. It’s rife with sharks and venomous jellyfish; the black icebergs are hiding their treasures and demons deep in those waters, and only the bravest dare to dive into the abyss. Heedless to the siren’s call of the outside world with its ready pleasures, empty promises, and shallow dopamine bursts that captivate the weak and naïve, these mavericks submerge headfirst daily.

Most dives bring nothing but the pain of realization and irritate the old scars aplenty. But on rare occasions, they bring back the rarest pearls of acceptance, epiphanies, and calm understanding that enable them to love and care for the outside world and themselves.

<p>
To remain human is to keep searching.
</p>
<p>To feel alive is to keep submerging.</p>
<p>To ascend and to transcend is to steer this spotlight tirelessly despite the bleeding hands clutching its handles wrapped in barbed wire.</p>
<p>Because the alternative is a passive existence that is indistinguishable from death.</p>
