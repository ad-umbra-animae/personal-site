<p>
I am the blade.
</p>
<p>
These pages are my steel.
</p>
<p>
These words are my edge. 
</p>

  <figcaption class="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2">I will tear through the layers...</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I hone my skills and sharpen my blade incessantly.
</p>
<p>
So that when the moment strikes, I will pierce all of your defenses effortlessly, as rice paper.
</p>
<p>
I will tear through layers of social conditioning, childhood trauma, cultural biases, and a plethora of falsehoods.
</p>
<p>
My unstoppable march will end when I hit the diamond in the center of your heart. The blade will smash on the surface 
and shatter into thousands of smithereens.
</p>
<p>
I hope the clang of my shattered steel will spark the light in your faded crystal, igniting your desire to act, change, 
and be your best self.
</p>
<p>
And you will rise again, unshackled at last.
</p>
